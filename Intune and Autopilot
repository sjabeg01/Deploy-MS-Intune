This is my project of one of our Client called SBA.
🎯 Use Cases
🔹 Intune Enrollment
•	You want to start managing users' existing PCs without affecting their data.
•	You want to enforce compliance policies, install software, and apply configuration profiles.
•	Best when:
o	Devices are already Azure AD joined.
o	You don’t want to wipe/reset devices.
✅ No wipe
✅ Easy to roll out
❌ No deep provisioning or OOBE branding


🔹 Autopilot Enrollment
•	You are deploying new laptops or reassigning old ones.
•	You want to give users a fresh setup experience (like new out of the box).
•	You want to automate provisioning, enforce standard configurations, and set branding.
✅ Standardizes setup
✅ Automates provisioning
❌ Requires device reset
❌ Not suited for in-use devices unless you want to wipe them


🛠️ Technical Setup Differences
✅ Intune Auto-Enrollment Setup:
1.	Go to: Intune admin center → Devices → Enroll Devices → Automatic Enrollment
2.	Set:
o	MDM User Scope: All (or a specific group)
o	MAM User Scope: Optional (only for app protection on BYOD)
3.	 What happens next:
When a user signs into a supported Windows device with their Azure AD account (Azure AD join), the device:
o	Automatically registers with Azure AD (if not already)
o	Auto-enrolls into Intune
o	Appears in Devices → All Devices in Intune
📌 This is a silent, background process. No reboot, no reset, no user interruption.

✅Hence, To manage existing Windows PCs (already in use):
You do NOT need:
•	Autopilot
•	Serial numbers
•	Deployment profile
You DO need:
•	Intune MDM Authority set (automatically done in Business Premium tenants)
•	MDM user scope set to "All" or a group
•	Azure AD joined (or Hybrid AADJ) devices
•	Optional: Company Portal (if doing user-driven enrollment)
Once a user signs into a Windows 10/11 device with Azure AD and is in MDM scope → device gets enrolled in Intune.
✅ No reset, no serial upload, no Autopilot profile.

✅ Autopilot Enrollment Setup:
1.	Collect hardware hash (Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo.ps1)
2.	Upload to: Devices → Enroll Devices → Windows Autopilot Devices
3.	Assign a Deployment Profile
4.	Reset device (e.g., Wipe via Intune or manual reinstall)
5.	On next boot: device runs Autopilot OOBE and auto-joins Azure AD + Intune
🔁 Wipes existing data and configures as per profile (Without a reset, Autopilot profiles won’t apply)
