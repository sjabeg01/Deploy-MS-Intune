Intune Auto-Enrollment vs. Windows Autopilot
Feature	Intune Automatic Enrollment	Windows Autopilot Enrollment
What it is	Background device enrollment into Intune when a user signs in.	Deployment service that provisions new or re-purposed devices during OOBE.
When it happens	After a user signs in to Windows with an Entra ID (Azure AD) account (if in MDM scope).	During Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) on first boot or after device reset.
Requires reset?	❌ No reset needed – works on existing devices.	✅ Yes – must go through OOBE → requires new device or device reset. Restart alone won’t work.
Trigger steps	1. In Intune admin center → Devices → Windows enrollment → Automatic enrollment.2. Set MDM user scope = All or group.3. User signs in → device auto-enrolls silently.	1. Import hardware hash (OEM, Intune, PowerShell).2. Assign Autopilot deployment profile.3. Reset device (Wipe, Fresh Start, or Autopilot Reset).4. Device boots into OOBE and applies profile.
Device visibility	Device appears in Intune → Devices list once enrolled.	Device appears in Intune and is also marked as Autopilot registered.
End-user experience	Transparent; no OOBE or re-setup required.	Guided OOBE with optional branding, user type (admin/standard), app installs, and Enrollment Status Page.
Customization	Apply Intune MDM policies, compliance rules, apps, security baselines.	Preconfigure device naming, user account type, OEM branding, ESP, apps, and enrollment options.
Ideal for	Managing existing devices already in use (no data loss).	New devices or re-purposed devices where standardized provisioning is needed.

🎯 Use Cases
🔹 Intune Enrollment
•	You want to start managing users' existing PCs without affecting their data.
•	You want to enforce compliance policies, install software, and apply configuration profiles.
•	Best when:
o	Devices are already Azure AD joined.
o	You don’t want to wipe/reset devices.
✅ No wipe
✅ Easy to roll out
❌ No deep provisioning or OOBE branding

🔹 Autopilot Enrollment
•	You are deploying new laptops or reassigning old ones.
•	You want to give users a fresh setup experience (like new out of the box).
•	You want to automate provisioning, enforce standard configurations, and set branding.
✅ Standardizes setup
✅ Automates provisioning
❌ Requires device reset
❌ Not suited for in-use devices unless you want to wipe them

🛠️ Technical Setup Differences
✅ Intune Auto-Enrollment Setup:
1.	Go to: Intune admin center → Devices → Enroll Devices → Automatic Enrollment
2.	Set:
o	MDM User Scope: All (or a specific group)
o	MAM User Scope: Optional (only for app protection on BYOD)
3.	 What happens next:
When a user signs into a supported Windows device with their Azure AD account, the device:
o	Automatically registers with Azure AD (if not already)
o	Auto-enrolls into Intune
o	Appears in Devices → All Devices in Intune
📌 This is a silent, background process. No reboot, no reset, no user interruption.

✅Hence, To manage existing Windows PCs (already in use):
You do NOT need:
•	Autopilot
•	Serial numbers
•	Deployment profile
You DO need:
•	Intune MDM Authority set (automatically done in Business Premium tenants)
•	MDM user scope set to "All" or a group
•	Azure AD joined (or Hybrid AADJ) devices
•	Optional: Company Portal (if doing user-driven enrollment)
Once a user signs into a Windows 10/11 device with Azure AD and is in MDM scope → device gets enrolled in Intune.
✅ No reset, no serial upload, no Autopilot profile.

✅ Autopilot Enrollment Setup:
1.	Collect hardware hash (Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo.ps1)
2.	Upload to: Devices → Enroll Devices → Windows Autopilot Devices
3.	Assign a Deployment Profile
4.	Reset device (e.g., Wipe via Intune or manual reinstall)
5.	On next boot: device runs Autopilot OOBE and auto-joins Azure AD + Intune
🔁 Wipes existing data and configures as per profile (Without a reset, Autopilot profiles won’t apply)
